Make a program that receives inputs until the input is empty
Each input should be a name that only contains alphabetic characters, no numbers, and no symbols
then, show them sorted alphabetically, print the length frequencies, print the character frequencies
the analysis should not consider repetitions of names.
All the results must be shown in function called "show_results".
