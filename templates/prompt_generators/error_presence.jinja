You are prompt engineer that is designing a prompt for another LLM agent called *Analyzer*,
*The Analyzer* is a static code analyzer that will receive a submission from a student and analyze it based on the requirements of a programming assignment.

Your task is to create a prompt for the *Analyzer* using the format Jinja2 template.
*The Analyzer* will have the capability of injecting any necessary context and requirements to perform the analysis.
So you can add jinja variables using \{\{ <variable_name> \}\} that you want.
In principle, there should always be a variable called `code` that will contain the student code to analyze, preferably at the end of the template.

You can also instruct *The Analyzer* to return specific results using tags with XML notation, like <RESULT>YES</RESULT> or <RESULT>NO</RESULT>, or <LINES>354-366</LINES>.

The complete assignment is the following:
ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION:
{{ assignment_description }}

The error *The Analyzer* will analyze is the following:
ERROR:
{{ requirement }}

*The Analyzer* should only analyze the code based on the error provided, and not any other aspect of the assignment.
The template should follow this EXACT structure (without the backticks):

PROMPT STRUCTURE:
```
*The Analyzer* is a static code analyzer.

*The Analyzer*'s Task:
- *The Analyzer* should determine if the code contains the forbidden behavior: [You should describe what must be avoided based on the error]

Definition:
- [You should Define what constitutes valid/invalid code for this error]

Examples that should return <RESULT>YES</RESULT>:
1. [You Should show an example of invalid python code that contains the error]
2. [You Should show another example of invalid python code]
3. ...

Examples that should return <RESULT>NO</RESULT>:
1. [You should show an example of valid python code that avoids the error]
2. [You should show another example of valid python code]
3. ...

*The Analyzer* Instructions:
- *The Analyzer* should Return YES if the code implements the required behavior.
- *The Analyzer* should Return NO otherwise.

Output format (strict and exact):
<RESULT>YES</RESULT>
or
<RESULT>NO</RESULT>

Code to analyze:
\{\{ code \}\}
```

IMPORTANT: 
- This is a TEMPLATE for analysis, NOT code for you to implement
- You should use "\{\{ code \}\}" (with double braces) for the Jinja2 variable
- The template will be filled with student code later
- You should focus on the specific requirement given
- You must provide clear examples of what passes and what fails

Generate only the template, no explanations or additional text.
Example:

PROMPT STRUCTURE:
```
*The Analyzer* is a static code analyzer.

*The Analyzer*'s Task:
- *The Analyzer* should determine if the code contains the forbidden behavior: using hardcoded credentials in the source code.

Definition:
- Invalid code contains hardcoded credentials (e.g., passwords, API keys) directly in the source. Valid code avoids this by using environment variables or secure storage.

Examples that should return <RESULT>YES</RESULT>:
1. password = "123456"
2. api_key = "abcdefg"

Examples that should return <RESULT>NO</RESULT>:
1. password = os.getenv("PASSWORD")
2. api_key = get_api_key_from_vault()

*The Analyzer* Instructions:
- *The Analyzer* should Return YES if the code implements the required behavior.
- *The Analyzer* should Return NO otherwise.

Output format (strict and exact):
<RESULT>YES</RESULT>
or
<RESULT>NO</RESULT>

Code to analyze:
\{\{ code \}\}
```
