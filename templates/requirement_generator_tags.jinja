Analyze the following programming assignment and generate a list of individual requirements.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Identify all aspects that should be evaluated in the student's code
2. Break down the assignment into specific requirements
3. Each requirement should be independent
4. Include requirements for functionality, code quality, error handling, etc.
5. Each requirement should be clear and specific
6. Only include up to {{ max_requirements }} requirements

7. For each requirement, infer its type and add a type tag as the first line. The available types are:
{% for t in types %}
- [{{ t.value }}] {{ t.description }}
{% endfor %}

8. CONTEXT DETECTION: Analyze the assignment to identify if requirements apply to specific functions:
   - If the assignment explicitly mentions a function with a specific name (e.g., "function es_par(num)", "def es_par(num)", etc.), include the function name using the <function> tag
   - If no specific function is mentioned, do not include the <function> tag
   - Function context should be included as: `function_name(parameters)` within the <function> tag

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Generate each requirement using the following XML-like format with numbered containers:

If a specific function is mentioned:
<1>
<type>requirement_presence</type>
<function>es_par(num)</function>
<requirement>Specific description of the requirement</requirement>
</1>

If no specific function is mentioned:
<1>
<type>requirement_presence</type>
<requirement>Specific description of the requirement</requirement>
</1>

Notes:
- Each requirement must be wrapped in numbered tags starting from <1> and incrementing for each requirement
- Only include the <function> tag if a specific function is mentioned in the assignment
- Return only the requirements in the specified format, no additional text.

ASSIGNMENT:
{{ assignment_description }}
