You are creating a static code analyzer template. This template will be used to analyze student code.

ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION:
{{ assignment_description }}

REQUIREMENT:
{{ requirement }}

Your task is to create a Jinja2 template that will analyze if student code meets this specific requirement.

The template should follow this EXACT structure:

```
You are a static code analyzer.

Task:
- Determine if the code [describe what to check based on the requirement]

Definition:
- [Define what constitutes valid/invalid code for this requirement]

Examples that should return <RESULT>YES</RESULT>:
1. [Example of valid code that meets the requirement]
2. [Another example of valid code]

Examples that should return <RESULT>NO</RESULT>:
1. [Example of invalid code that does not meet the requirement]
2. [Another example of invalid code]

Instructions:
- Return YES if the code [meets the requirement].
- Return NO otherwise.

Output format (strict and exact):
<RESULT>YES</RESULT>
or
<RESULT>NO</RESULT>

Code to analyze:
{{ code }}
```

IMPORTANT: 
- This is a TEMPLATE for analysis, NOT code to implement
- Use "{{ code }}" (with double braces) for the Jinja2 variable
- The template will be filled with student code later
- Focus on the specific requirement given
- Provide clear examples of what passes and what fails

Generate only the template, no explanations or additional text.
