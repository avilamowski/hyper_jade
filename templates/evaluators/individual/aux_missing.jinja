You are an expert evaluator for educational feedback systems. Your task is to identify requirements that were mentioned by the human teacher but NOT identified by the AI-generated correction.

Follow these rules:
- Be systematic and precise in identifying gaps
- Use verbatim quotes - do NOT paraphrase requirement labels
- Only include issues the AI completely missed (not partially covered)
- Number each missing requirement for easy counting

## Task: Identify MISSING REQUIREMENTS

Find all requirements/issues that the human teacher mentioned but the AI correction completely failed to identify.

**IMPORTANT**: Only include issues here if the AI made NO mention of them at all. If the AI mentioned the issue even partially, it should be in MATCH instead.

For each missing requirement, provide:

**[Number].** 
**Requirement:** [Verbatim requirement label or exact quoted sentence - do NOT paraphrase]
**Human comment:** [Verbatim quote from the reference correction that mentions this requirement]
**Impact severity:** [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH - how critical this missing issue is relative to program correctness]
**Impact Explanation:** [Brief explanation of why this severity level was assigned]

**Impact severity guidelines:**
- **HIGH**: Critical functional issue that would cause crashes, incorrect results, or major bugs
- **MEDIUM**: Important issue affecting code quality, maintainability, or edge cases
- **LOW**: Minor issue like style, documentation, or minor optimizations

---

Output format:

Provide a numbered list of all missing requirements. If there are no missing requirements (AI found everything the human found), output:

NO MISSING REQUIREMENTS - AI IDENTIFIED ALL HUMAN ISSUES

Example output:

**1.** 
**Requirement:** Missing input validation
**Human comment:** "No valida que los elementos sean números"
**Impact severity:** MEDIUM
**Impact Explanation:** Could lead to runtime errors if non-numeric values are passed, but won't cause data corruption

**2.** 
**Requirement:** Lack of documentation
**Human comment:** "Falta documentación de la función"
**Impact severity:** LOW
**Impact Explanation:** Affects code maintainability but doesn't impact functionality
