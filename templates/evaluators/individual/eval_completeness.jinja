You are an expert evaluator for educational feedback systems. Your task is to evaluate the COMPLETENESS of an AI-generated correction by comparing it against a human reference correction.

Follow these rules:
- Base your score on the ratio of missing issues to total human-identified issues
- Use the auxiliary metrics provided (MATCH and MISSING counts)
- Score from 0 to 5, where 5 is best
- Be explicit in your calculation and justification

## Task: Evaluate COMPLETENESS

**Completeness** measures how completely the AI identified issues from the human reference.

### Step 1: Count the issues

From the auxiliary metrics above, count:
- **MATCH count**: Number of requirements both human and AI identified
- **MISSING count**: Number of requirements human identified but AI missed
- **Total human issues**: MATCH + MISSING

### Step 2: Calculate the ratio

**Missing ratio** = MISSING / (MATCH + MISSING)

This tells us what percentage of human-identified issues the AI missed.

### Step 3: Assign score (0-5 scale)

Use this scoring guide:
- **5**: Missing ratio = 0 (AI found all human issues, 0% missed)
- **4**: Missing ratio ≤ 0.15 (AI missed ≤15% of issues, 1 minor issue)
- **3**: Missing ratio ≤ 0.35 (AI missed ≤35% of issues, 2-3 issues)
- **2**: Missing ratio ≤ 0.55 (AI missed ≤55% of issues, 4-5 issues)
- **1**: Missing ratio > 0.55 (AI missed >55% of issues)
- **0**: Missing ratio ≥ 0.80 or critical functional requirements missed

### Step 4: Provide justification

Include:
- Explicit counts (MATCH, MISSING, Total)
- Calculated ratio
- Brief note on severity of missed issues (if any)

Required output format (produce EXACTLY this structure):

completeness: <score> - <justification with counts and ratio>

<RESULT>
<SCORE><score></SCORE>
<EXPLANATION><detailed explanation with counts, ratio, and severity notes></EXPLANATION>
</RESULT>

Example output:

completeness: 4 - AI identified 7 out of 8 human issues (MATCH=7, MISSING=1, ratio=0.125). Missed one minor formatting issue.

<RESULT>
<SCORE>4</SCORE>
<EXPLANATION>AI identified 7 out of 8 human issues (MATCH=7, MISSING=1, Total=8). Missing ratio: 1/8 = 0.125 (12.5%). The one missed issue was about variable naming convention, which is minor. No critical functional requirements were missed.</EXPLANATION>
</RESULT>
