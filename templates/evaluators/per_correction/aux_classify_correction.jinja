You are an expert evaluator for educational feedback systems. Your task is to classify a single human correction.

# TASK

Determine if this human correction is MISSING from the AI output.
Only classify as MATCH if you find a clear, strong correspondence with an AI correction.

> WARNING: Do NOT force a match. It is completely acceptable and expected
> that many human corrections will be MISSING from the AI output.

# Human Correction to Classify

{{ human_correction }}

# Available AI Corrections (ERROR FOUND only)

The following are AI corrections that identified errors in the student code.
Note: Only corrections that found actual errors are listed here. "NO ERROR" results are excluded.

{{ ai_corrections }}

# Student Code (for context)

```python
{{ student_code }}
```

# YOUR TASK

Determine if ANY of the AI corrections above match the human correction semantically.

## IMPORTANT: What is a MATCH?

Two corrections are a **MATCH** if they refer to the **same specific problem/error**, even if:
- They use different words or technical terminology
- One describes the symptom, the other describes the root cause
- One uses linting error codes (like F405, E501), the other describes the runtime behavior
- One is more technical, the other is more descriptive

A MATCH requires:
- The **same type of issue** is identified (e.g., both about missing validation, both about incorrect return value)

## IMPORTANT: What is NOT a MATCH?

- An AI correction that says "NO ERROR" or finds no problem CANNOT match a human correction that reports an error
- Different issues are NOT a match (e.g., human reports validation error, AI reports formatting issue)
- If no AI corrections are provided, the result is MISSING

## WHEN IN DOUBT: MISSING

If you are uncertain whether a match exists, classify as **MISSING**.
A weak or tangential connection is NOT a match.

## Examples of MATCHES:

- Human: "Error de ejecución porque puso r en vez de 'r'"
AI: "Undefined name `r` en la línea 52"
→ MATCH (both about missing quotes)

- Human: "No valida la entrada"
AI: "Falta validación para el parámetro cantidad"
→ MATCH (both about input validation)

## Examples of NO MATCH:

- Human: "No valida precio positivo"
AI: "Debería usar enumerate"
→ NO MATCH (different issues)

- Human: "Error en el cálculo de stock"
AI: "NO ERROR - The code correctly updates stock"
→ NO MATCH (AI didn't find the error)

# OUTPUT FORMAT

Respond with XML inside <RESULT> tags.

  ## If MISSING (no AI correction matches):

  <RESULT>
    <CLASSIFICATION>MISSING</CLASSIFICATION>
    <IMPACT_SEVERITY>HIGH or MEDIUM or LOW</IMPACT_SEVERITY>
    <EXPLANATION>Brief explanation of why no AI correction matches</EXPLANATION>
  </RESULT>

  - **IMPACT_SEVERITY**:
  - HIGH: Critical functional issue
  - MEDIUM: Important issue affecting quality
  - LOW: Minor issue

  ## If MATCH (an AI correction matches):

  <RESULT>
    <CLASSIFICATION>MATCH</CLASSIFICATION>
    <HUMAN_CORRECTION>Copy the human correction being classified here</HUMAN_CORRECTION>
    <MATCHED_AI_CORRECTION>Copy the full text of the matching AI correction here</MATCHED_AI_CORRECTION>
    <MATCHED_AI_INDEX>index of matching AI correction (1-based)</MATCHED_AI_INDEX>
    <MATCH_QUALITY>FULL or HIGH</MATCH_QUALITY>
    <EXPLANATION>Brief explanation of the match</EXPLANATION>
  </RESULT>

  - **HUMAN_CORRECTION**: The human correction being classified (copy from above)
  - **MATCHED_AI_CORRECTION**: The full text of the AI correction that matches (copy from above)
  - **MATCHED_AI_INDEX**: 1-based index of the AI correction that matches (e.g., 1 for [AI Correction 1])
  - **MATCH_QUALITY**:
  - FULL: AI captured exact same issue
  - GENERAL: Same core issue, but Human provided more specific details
  - SPECIFIC: Same core issue, but AI provided more specific details
