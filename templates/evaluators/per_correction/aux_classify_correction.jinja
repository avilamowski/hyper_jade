You are an expert evaluator for educational feedback systems. Your task is to classify a single human correction.

# TASK

Determine if any AI correction matches (semantically) this human correction.

---HUMAN---

# Human Correction to Classify

{{ human_correction }}

# Available AI Corrections (ERROR FOUND only)

The following are AI corrections that identified errors in the student code.
Note: Only corrections that found actual errors are listed here. "NO ERROR" results are excluded.

{{ ai_corrections }}

# Student Code (for context)

```python
{{ student_code }}
```

# YOUR TASK

Determine if ANY of the AI corrections above match the human correction semantically.

## IMPORTANT: What is a MATCH?

Two corrections are a **MATCH** if they refer to the **same underlying problem/error**, even if:
- They use different words or technical terminology
- One describes the symptom, the other describes the root cause
- One uses linting error codes (like F405, E501), the other describes the runtime behavior
- One is more technical, the other is more descriptive

## IMPORTANT: What is NOT a MATCH?

- An AI correction that says "NO ERROR" or finds no problem CANNOT match a human correction that reports an error
- Different issues are NOT a match (e.g., human reports validation error, AI reports formatting issue)
- If no AI corrections are provided, the result is MISSING

## Examples of MATCHES:

- Human: "Error de ejecución porque puso r en vez de 'r'"
AI: "Undefined name `r` en la línea 52"
→ MATCH (both about missing quotes)

- Human: "No valida la entrada"
AI: "Falta validación para el parámetro cantidad"
→ MATCH (both about input validation)

## Examples of NO MATCH:

- Human: "No valida precio positivo"
AI: "Debería usar enumerate"
→ NO MATCH (different issues)

- Human: "Error en el cálculo de stock"
AI: "NO ERROR - The code correctly updates stock"
→ NO MATCH (AI didn't find the error)

# OUTPUT FORMAT

Respond with XML inside <RESULT> tags:

  <RESULT>
    <CLASSIFICATION>MATCH or MISSING</CLASSIFICATION>
    <MATCHED_AI_INDEX>index of matching AI correction (0-based), or -1 if MISSING</MATCHED_AI_INDEX>
    <MATCH_QUALITY>FULL or HIGH or PARTIAL</MATCH_QUALITY>
    <IMPACT_SEVERITY>HIGH or MEDIUM or LOW (only relevant if MISSING)</IMPACT_SEVERITY>
    <EXPLANATION>Brief explanation of your decision</EXPLANATION>
  </RESULT>

  ## Field Descriptions:

  - **CLASSIFICATION**: "MATCH" if an AI correction matches, "MISSING" if none match
  - **MATCHED_AI_INDEX**: 0-based index of the AI correction that matches (-1 if MISSING)
  - **MATCH_QUALITY**:
  - FULL: AI captured exact same issue
  - HIGH: Same core issue, minor differences
  - PARTIAL: AI mentioned it but missed details
  - **IMPACT_SEVERITY** (only for MISSING):
  - HIGH: Critical functional issue
  - MEDIUM: Important issue affecting quality
  - LOW: Minor issue
