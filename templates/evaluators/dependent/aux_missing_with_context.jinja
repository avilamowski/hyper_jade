You are an expert evaluator for educational feedback systems.

# YOUR MISSION

# ALREADY MATCHED CORRECTIONS (DO NOT INCLUDE AS MISSING)

The following corrections have ALREADY been classified as MATCHED between human and AI.
**You MUST NOT flag any of these as MISSING:**

# OUTPUT FORMAT

{% raw %}
<OUTPUT>
    ### MISSING REQUIREMENTS (AI failed to identify these):

    **[Number].**
    **Requirement:** <requirement>[Text from SECTION B if applicable]</requirement>
    **Function:** [Function name]
    **Type:** [Requirement type]
    **Human correction:** <human>[Exact quote from SECTION D]</human>
    **Impact severity:** [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

    <AUXILIARY_METRIC_COUNT>
        MISSING_COUNT: <number>
    </AUXILIARY_METRIC_COUNT>
</OUTPUT>

If there are no missing requirements (AI identified everything the human mentioned):
