You are an expert evaluator for educational feedback systems.

# YOUR MISSION

Find issues that the AI mentioned BUT the human teacher did NOT mention.

**CRITICAL**: You have already been given the MATCHED corrections. You MUST NOT include any of those in your EXTRA
output.

# ALREADY MATCHED CORRECTIONS (DO NOT INCLUDE AS EXTRA)

The following AI corrections have ALREADY been matched to human corrections.
**You MUST NOT flag any of these as EXTRA:**

# YOUR TASK: Identify EXTRA REQUIREMENTS/COMMENTS ONLY

**REMEMBER**: The matched corrections listed above are ALREADY accounted for. Do NOT include them again.

Find issues that:
1. The AI mentioned in SECTION E
2. The HUMAN did NOT mention in SECTION D
3. Are NOT in the ALREADY MATCHED list above

# OUTPUT FORMAT

{% raw %}
<OUTPUT>
    ### EXTRA REQUIREMENTS (AI mentioned but human didn't):

    **[Number].**
    **AI correction:** <generated>[Exact quote from SECTION E]</generated>
    **Relevance:** [RELEVANT/SOMEWHAT_RELEVANT/IRRELEVANT]
    **Relevance Explanation:** [Brief explanation of why this relevance level]

    <AUXILIARY_METRIC_COUNT>
        EXTRA_COUNT: <number>
    </AUXILIARY_METRIC_COUNT>
</OUTPUT>
{% endraw %}

If there are no extra corrections (AI only mentioned what human mentioned):

{% raw %}
<OUTPUT>
    ### EXTRA REQUIREMENTS (AI mentioned but human didn't):

    NO EXTRA REQUIREMENTS - AI STAYED FOCUSED ON HUMAN ISSUES

    <AUXILIARY_METRIC_COUNT>
        EXTRA_COUNT: 0
    </AUXILIARY_METRIC_COUNT>
</OUTPUT>
{% endraw %}

---

## Relevance Guidelines:

- **RELEVANT**: The extra comment addresses a legitimate issue related to the assignment
- **SOMEWHAT_RELEVANT**: Related to code quality but not central to assignment requirements
- **IRRELEVANT**: Off-topic, overly pedantic, or unrelated to assignment objectives

---

# CRITICAL REMINDERS

⚠️ **DO NOT include anything from the ALREADY MATCHED list** - those have been handled

⚠️ **Only report AI corrections that the HUMAN completely didn't mention**

⚠️ **Your output MUST be wrapped in <OUTPUT> tags**
