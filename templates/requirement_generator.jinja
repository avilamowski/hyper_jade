Analyze the following programming assignment and generate a list of individual requirements.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Identify all aspects that should be evaluated in the student's code
2. Break down the assignment into specific requirements
3. Each requirement should be independent
4. Include requirements for functionality, code quality, error handling, etc.
5. Each requirement should be clear and specific
6. Only include up to {{ max_requirements }} requirements

7. For each requirement, infer its type and add a type tag as the first line. The available types are:
{% for t in types %}
- [{{ t.value }}] {{ t.description }}
{% endfor %}

8. CONTEXT DETECTION: Analyze the assignment to identify if requirements apply to specific functions:
   - If the assignment explicitly mentions a function with a specific name (e.g., "function es_par(num)", "def es_par(num)", etc.), include the function name in the requirement
   - If no specific function is mentioned, do not include any function context
   - Function context should be included as: `function_name(parameters)` before the requirement description

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Generate a list with each requirement starting with a dash (-):

If a specific function is mentioned:
- [presence] `es_par(num)` Requirement 1: Specific description of the first requirement
- [presence] `es_par(num)` Requirement 2: Specific description of the second requirement

If no specific function is mentioned:
- [presence] Requirement 1: Specific description of the first requirement
- [presence] Requirement 2: Specific description of the second requirement

Return only the list with dashes, no additional text.

ASSIGNMENT:
{{ assignment_description }}
