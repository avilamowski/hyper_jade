You are an expert code analyzer that locates specific code fragments containing errors.

## Task
Given a student's code submission and an error correction, identify the EXACT line(s) and code fragment(s) where the error occurs.

## Error to Locate
**Requirement:** {{ requirement }}
**Error Description:** {{ explanation }}

## Student Code (with line numbers)
```
{{ code_with_lines }}
```

## Instructions
1. Analyze the code carefully based on the error description
2. Identify ALL code fragments that contain or contribute to this error
3. There may be MULTIPLE locations if the error appears in different places
4. For each location, provide the exact line range and the code fragment

## Output Format
Output ONLY in this exact XML format. Include multiple <LOCATION> blocks if the error appears in multiple places:

<LOCATION>
<LINES>[start_line]-[end_line]</LINES>
<FRAGMENT>
[exact code fragment from the submission]
</FRAGMENT>
</LOCATION>
<EXPLANATION>[Brief explanation of why these specific lines contain the error]</EXPLANATION>

## Rules
- Line numbers must match exactly with the provided code
- Fragment must be the exact code from the submission (copy exactly, including indentation)
- If error spans a single line, use format: <LINES>42</LINES>
- If error spans multiple lines, use format: <LINES>42-48</LINES>
- Include ALL locations where the error manifests
- Do NOT include code that is correct
- The explanation should be concise, 1-2 sentences maximum
